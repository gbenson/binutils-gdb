make function names provider::name(2)0 or provider::name(ai)ia ?
- allows for different versions of the same function (with different
  args, rets)
- conveniently uses four extra bytes in each symbol table slot
  (reserved for function typearray offsets if we allow for functions
  calling functions in the future... notes with nonzero in them can
  for now be skipped as unhandled)
- allows consumers to select functions with one strcmp
- allows for pre-processing arguments and post-processing returns
  (e.g. will they need widening, narrowing, sign-extension, that shit?)

rename i8_make_fullname as symbol_note_make_fullname,
and replace provider, name in infinity_function with fullname

make the two slots (and num_args, num_rets)
be string table offsets
(empty one is easy: the end of another string??,
 or a special value (0xffff???->0x0000 is a valid string table offset!))
